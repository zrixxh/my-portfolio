    <h1>Welcome to Zrixxh's Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hey! I'm Zrixxh, a 21-year-old gaming enthusiast from the UK. This portfolio is a glimpse into what I do, what I enjoy, and the exciting projects I’m working on.</p>

    <p>Gaming is my passion—I spend my time immersed in titles like GTA V, Call of Duty, FiveM, Battlefield V, CSGO 2, Roblox, Apex Legends, Watch Dogs 2, Mafia, and the upcoming FragPunk. Whether it’s action-packed FPS, immersive roleplay, or open-world exploration, I love it all.</p>

    <p>Beyond gaming, I’m currently working on an exciting app called <strong>Scythe</strong>, which aims to be the best social media app ever. I’m putting my heart and soul into making it a game-changer in the digital world.</p>

    <p>On the personal side, I’m a proud parent to my wonderful kid, Winter-Rose, and I’m happily engaged to my amazing fiancé, Amy, who is also 21.</p>

    <p>Thanks for visiting my portfolio! Here you’ll find updates on my gaming journey, projects, and life. Let’s connect and share the adventure.</p>
